# Remote Control Car GUI

A Java-based project featuring a drag-and-drop GUI (using `.form` files) to simulate the control of a remote-control car.  
The application allows user interactions via a graphical interface and stores the control data in an **Oracle Database**.

## Features
- GUI created using Java Swing with drag-and-drop `.form` design.
- Control panel for simulating remote car movement (forward, backward, left, right, stop).
- Logs user inputs and control actions into Oracle Database.
- Demonstrates integration of Java applications with relational databases.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend (GUI):** Java Swing, `.form` designer
- **Backend:** Java
- **Database:** Oracle Database
- **IDE/Tools:** NetBeans (for GUI form design), Oracle SQL Developer (for DB management)

## How It Works
1. User interacts with the GUI to control the car.
2. Each action is captured in the Java program.
3. The action is logged into the Oracle Database for tracking.
